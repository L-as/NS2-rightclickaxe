# About

This mod makes right-click an attack with the axe, when marine.
This applies to **all** marine weapons, and thus you should always be able to quickly defend
yourself against a near enemy.

The third slot is no longer used by the axe, but instead only by the welder, and also the **builder**. The builder is the weapon you have before the welder, which you use to build (but not weld) stuff.

#Future changes

It will be configurable whether right-click will be axe or welder
